CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF OVENS' STATUS SHOULD BE CHANGED FROM
IDLE TO ABANDONED.  THE NUMBER OF BEEHIVE OVENS COUNTED AS

THE INDICATED INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 1922 TO

RATED CAPACITY OF CERTAIN PLANTS AS REPORTED BY THE
OPERATORS TO THE GEOLOGIC SURVEY.
WHILE THE ANNUAL FIGURES THROUGH 1939 WERE BASED ON

FIGURE (59,394,070 TONS) WAS OBTAINED THROUGH A SPECIAL
SURVEY (SEE MINERALS YEARBOOK 1940, P.870) AND IS PROBABLY
NOT QUITE COMPARABLE TO EARLIER DATA.  THE CORRECTED FIGURE

NOTES:  DATA REPRESENT TOTAL SHIPMENTS LESS SHIPMENTS FOR
ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT AND FOR EXPORTS; THE LATTER SERIES HAS
BEEN REVISED TO EXCLUDE SHIPMENTS TO NONCONTIGUOUS U.S.
TERRITORIES WHICH PREVIOUSLY WERE CONSIDERED AS EXPORTS.
HOWEVER, SOME FIRMS STILL FOLLOW THAT PRACTICE.  THE CHIEF
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RMA'S DATA AND THE EXPORTS COMPILED
BY THE U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS IS THAT THE RMA'S DATA
COVER ONLY SHIPMENTS OF NEW PNEUMATIC CASINGS, WHILE THE
OFFICIAL U.S. EXPORTS COVER USED AND RETREADED AS WELL.
LEND-LEASE SHIPMENTS WERE CONSIDERED AS REPLACEMENT
SHIPMENTS FROM 1941-1945.  SHIPMENTS FOR ORDERS BY THE
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC WARFARE (ORIGINALLY THE FOREIGN ECONOMIC
ADMINISTRATION) WERE, HOWEVER, CONSIDERED AS EXPORTS FROM
""LATE 1943 TO THE END OF 1945"" (1949 SURVEY OF CURRENT
BUSINESS, STATISTICAL SUPPLEMENT, P.284).
ON ACCOUNT OF GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS, EXPORTERS HAD TO
RETURN EQUIPMENT INTENDED FOR EXPORT, AND ALSO DEALERS HAD
TO RETURN EQUIPMENT TO MANUFACTURERS.  SHIPMENT FIGURES WERE
NOT ADJUSTED FOR SUCH RETURNS, AND THE FIGURES FOR 1942
""MUST NOT BE USED TO INDICATE TRENDS.""

YEAR WAS SUBTRACTED FROM THE FIGURE FOR THE YEAR BEING
COMPUTED.
FOR 1881-1956, THE ANNUAL FIGURES REFER TO WIRE MILEAGE

YEARS (1922, 1927, 1932, AND 1937) IN WHICH BUREAU OF THE
CENSUS DATA WERE USED. FOR THE SEGMENT 1956-1963, THE ANNUAL
FIGURES WERE DERIVED BY ADDING WIRE MILEAGE REPORTED BY BELL

THE INDEPENDENT COMPANIES ARE BASED ON OPERATING REPORTS
SUBMITTED BY EACH COMPANY TO THE U.S. INDEPENDENT TELEPHONE
ASSOCIATION. HOWEVER NOT ALL SUCH COMPANIES REPORT. THE DATA
FROM BELL TELEPHONE COMPANIES EXCLUDE DROP AND BLOCK WIRE.

NOTES: DATA REPRESENT TOTAL OUTPUT OF CONSTRUCTION
MATERIALS, LESS EXPORTS AND PLUS IMPORTS. CONSTRUCTION
MATERIALS INCLUDE (1) NONMANUFACTURED COMMODITIES, SUCH AS
LUMBER (DESTINED FOR DIRECT USE IN CONSTRUCTION), CROSS
TIES, SAND AND GRAVEL, AND CRUSHED STONE; AND (2)
MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS LUMBER PRODUCTS, CEMENT,
BRICK, RAILS, STRUCTURAL IRONWORK, ETC. (FOR COMPLETE LIST
OF MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, SEE SOURCE, PP. 133-135) THESE
COVERED COMMODITIES INCLUDE SOME WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED
DIRECTLY AS CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, AND ANOTHER GROUP OF
""MIXED COMMODITIES,"" SUCH AS LUMBER, WROUGHT PIPE, AND
STATUARY AND ART GOODS, FOR WHICH THE PROPORTION ALLOTABLE
TO CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS WAS ESTIMATED. VALUE ESTIMATES
EXCLUDE COSTS AFTER PRODUCTION, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION AND
DISTRIBUTION COSTS.
FOR THE PERIOD 1869-1919, OUTPUT, EXPORTS, AND IMPORTS
WERE ESTIMATED AS FOLLOWS. ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF OUTPUT
ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE""CENSUS OF MANUFACTURES"",
DECENNIALLY, 1869-1899, AND QUINQUENNIALLY, 1899- 1919.
INTERCENSAL ESTIMATES WERE DEVELOPED FROM STATE STATISTICAL
REPORTS FOR SEVEN STATES (SEE SOURCE, PP. 232-233), FIGURES
FROM GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE BUREAU OF MINES, AND
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, AND FROM TRADE ASSOCIATIONS
SUCH AS THE AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE (SEE SOURCE,
PP. 241-242). EXPORTS WERE COMPILED FROM DETAILED STATISTICS
IN THE DECEMBER ISSUES OF THE""MONTHLY SUMMARY OF FOREIGN
COMMERCE"" FOR 1893-1919. FOR 1869, AND 1889-1893,
CALENDAR-YEAR TOTALS WERE DERIVED FROM THE""QUARTERLY REPORT
OF THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF STATISTICS"", U.S.TREASURY
DEPARTMENT. THESE BASIC EXPORT STATISTICS WERE MODIFIED AS
TO CLASSIFICATION OF COMMODITIES, AND WERE ADJUSTED TO PRICE
LEVELS COMPARABLE WITH THE OUTPUT DATA (MANUFACTURERS' OR
PRODUCERS' PRICES). IMPORTS FOR CONSUMPTION, INCLUDING
DUTIES, WERE OBTAINED FROM FISCAL- YEAR DATA IN""FOREIGN
COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION"", AND WERE ADJUSTED TO A CALENDAR-
YEAR BASIS.
FOR THE PERIOD 1919-33, THE DATA ARE BASED ON KUZNETS'
ESTIMATES (""COMMODITY FLOW AND CAPITAL FORMATION"", I, NEW
YORK, NBER, 1938), ADJUSTED TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY WITH
EARLIER YEARS. RATIOS OF KUZNETS' UNADJUSTED VALUE OF
DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION TO HIS UNADJUSTED VALUE OF DOMESTIC
OUTPUT WERE COMPUTED FOR 1919 AND 1929 AND INTERPOLATED FOR
INTERVENING YEARS. THESE RATIOS WERE APPLIED TO KUZNETS'
ADJUSTED OUTPUT VALUES. AFTER 1933 THE ESTIMATES ARE ROUGH
EXTRAPOLATIONS.
VALUES IN 1913 PRICES WERE DERIVED BY APPLYING PRICE
INDEXES TO THE CURRENT PRICE SERIES. FOR 1914-39, BUREAU OF
LABOR STATISTICS INDEXES FOR LUMBER AND BUILDING MATERIALS
AND FOR STEEL RAILS WERE COMBINED, USING 1926 WEIGHTS. FOR
1890-1913, A SIMILAR COMPOSITE, USING 1909 WEIGHTS, WAS
COMBINED WITH AN INDEX OF STRUCTURAL STEEL PRICES, COMPUTED
FROM""METAL STATISTICS"", 1938. FOR YEARS BEFORE 1890, SERIES
ON ELEVEN COMMODITIES WERE COMBINED, USING 1909 BLS WEIGHTS,
AND THE RESULTING INDEX WAS LINKED TO THE SERIES FOR LATER
YEARS.

THIS SERIES COVERS DOCUMENTED MERCHANT VESSELS OF FIVE

THESE DATA ARE REPORTED IN""GROSS TONNAGE,"" WHICH REFERS
TO SPACE CAPACITY RATHER THAN WEIGHT. CURRENTLY ONE TON IS
CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT TO 100 CUBIC FEET; BEFORE 1865, ONE

ONLY NINE MONTHS. FIGURES FOR 1938-62 ARE NOT COMPARABLE
WITH THOSE FOR EARLIER YEARS AS THEY REPRESENT ONLY THOSE
VESSELS STILL IN EXISTENCE AS PART OF THE MERCHANT FLEET AT
THE END OF THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD IN WHICH THEY WERE BUILT.
THEREFORE, THEY EXCLUDE THOSE VESSELS WHICH WERE LOST, SOLD
TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, SOLD TO ALIENS, OR REMOVED FROM THE

PH.D. DISSERTATION, THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, 1934.

NOTES:  THE BASIC DATA FOR THIS SERIES AND FOR SERIES 02009
AND 02010 ARE RIGGLEMAN'S COMPILATIONS AND ESTIMATES OF THE
VALUE OF BUILDING PERMITS FOR AN INCREASING NUMBER OF U. S.
CITIES.  IN THE EARLY YEARS THEY ARE LARGELY ESTIMATES,
BASED MAINLY ON OTHER INFORMATION, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE
VALUATIONS.  VALUE FIGURES ARE FOR RESIDENTIAL AND
NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDING COMBINED,  INCLUDING ADDITIONS AND
ALTERATIONS. MANHATTAN, BOSTON AND WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM
1830 THROUGH 1848.  THE COVERAGE THEN INCREASES GRADUALLY TO
A TOTAL OF TEN CITIES BY 1868, AND TO SIXTY-FIVE CITIES FOR
1900 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  (FOR SPECIFIC CITIES COVERED
EACH YEAR, SEE COLEAN AND NEWCOMB, COMB, STABILIZING
CONSTRUCTION, APPENDIX N, TABLE 4, FN. C, P. 240.)  THE
SERIES ARE DOMINATED  BY MANHATTAN BEFORE 1870, AND TO SOME
EXTENT FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT.
SERIES 02009 REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF BUILDING
PERMITS IN THE CITIES COVERED, DIVIDED BY A COMBINED
POPULATION ESTIMATE FOR THESE CITIES.  THE POPULATION
ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON CENSUS FIGURES, WITH STRAIGHT-LINE
INTERPOLATION BETWEEN CENSUS YEARS.
RIGGLEMAN'S BASIC DATA WERE ADJUSTED BY WALTER ISARD IN
""THE ECONOMIC DYNAMICS OF TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGY"" (AN
UNPUBLISHED PH.D. DISSERTATION, YALE UNIVERSITY, 1947).  THE
RESULT WAS AN INDEX SIMILAR IN CONSTRUCTION TO LONG'S
INDEXES (SEE SERIES 02004 AND 02246).  THE POPULATION
ADJUSTMENT OF RIGGLEMAN'S SERIES
IS ELIMINATED.  THE PERMIT VALUES IN AN INDIVIDUAL  CITY ARE
CONVERTED TO RELATIVES OF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL VALUE OF
PERMITS IN THE SAME CITY DURING THE PERIOD 1920-29.  THE
COMBINED INDEX FOR EACH YEAR IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE
WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE RELATIVES FOR THE CITIES COVERED IN
THAT YEAR, WITH WEIGHTS PROPORTIONAL  TO PERMIT VALUES IN
THESE CITIES IN THE BASE PERIOD.

NOTES: THIS SERIES WAS COMPILED BY THE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT
STABILIZATION BOARD, WHOSE FUNCTIONS WERE TAKEN OVER IN THE
LATE THIRTIES BY THE FEDERAL STABILIZATION OFFICE, AND IN
1939 BY THE NATIONAL RESOURCES PLANNING BOARD. THE SERIES
WAS DISCONTINUED IN MAY 1942.
BY 1930, THE INDEX WAS COMPOSED OF THIRTY INDIVIDUAL
SERIES ON THE QUANTITY OF SHIPMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION
MATERIALS. TWELVE SERIES WERE USED BEGINNING IN 1925, AND
ADDITIONAL SERIES WERE ADDED AS THEY BECAME AVAILABLE. THE
INDIVIDUAL SERIES ARE WEIGHTED IN THE INDEX ACCORDING TO
RELATIVE COST OF THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.
THE MATERIALS INCLUDED IN THE INDEX AS OF JANUARY 1925
WERE: TERRA COTTA, FLOOR AND WALL TILE, STEEL PLATE,
ENAMELED SANITARY WARE, ASPHALT, CEMENT, EXPLOSIVES, FACE
BRICK, CAST IRON BOILERS, RADIATORS, OAK FLOORING, AND MAPLE
FLOORING. THESE WERE ADDED TO AS FOLLOWS: JULY 1925,
VITREOUS CHINA PLUMBING; JANUARY 1926, WATER SOFTENING
APPARATUS; JANUARY 1927, PUMPS AND WATER SYSTEMS, LIMESTONE,
CONCRETE REINFORCING STEEL; FEBRUARY 1927, STEEL BOILERS;
SEPTEMBER 1927, PLUMBING PORCELAIN; JANUARY 1928, PREPARED
ROOFING, GAS-FIRED BOILERS, RUBBER FLOORING, WINDOW GLASS;
JANUARY 1929, OIL BURNERS, PAINT AND VARNISH, LEAD PIPE,
OAKUM; JANUARY 1930, RANGE BOILERS, PLUMBERS' WOODWORK,
PLASTIC PAINTS.
SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT IS BY THE COMPILING AGENCY.
FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1941 TO MAY 1942 THE UNADJUSTED
AND SEASONALLY ADJUSTED DATA ARE INCONSISTENT AS TO LEVEL.
SINCE IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR US TO DETERMINE WHICH IS
CORRECT, THERE IS NOT AN ANNUAL FIGURE FOR 1941.
AN EARLIER INDEX, WHICH WAS A SIMPLE AVERAGE OF SIX
ITEMS, WAS COMPILED BY ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND
PUBLISHED IN THE""SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS"", MAY 1927,
P.22, THE 1932 ANNUAL SUPPLEMENT, P.36, AND LATER ISSUES. IT

THIS SERIES WAS COMPILED ACCORDING TO TWO DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS, HERE DESIGNATED AS""NBER DEFINITION"" AND ""DODGE
DEFINITION.""
THE NBER DEFINITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP WAS BASED ON
PROJECT TYPE.  THE DODGE DEFINITION, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS
BASED ON OWNERSHIP. BEGINNING IN 1932, INFORMATION ON
OWNERSHIP BECAME AVAILABLE, AND SERIES ON PRIVATELY OWNED
AND PUBLICLY OWNED CONSTRUCTION WERE COMPILED.
FOR INFORMATION ON COLLECTION PROCEDURES, COVERAGE, AND
DEFINITIONS, SEE INTRODUCTORY NOTES ON DODGE CORP. DATA, AND
LIPSEY & PRESTON, P. 232.
""NBER DEFINITION""  VARIABLES ARE THE SUM OF THESE NBER
SERIES:  RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (02011); COMMERCIAL AND
INDUSTRIAL BUILDING (02017); AND PUBLIC UTILITIES (02114).
""DODGE DEFINITION"" VARIABLES APPLY TO BUILDING AND
NONBUILDING PROJECTS UNDER PRIVATE OWNERSHIP.
FOR PURPOSES OF CYCLICAL ANALYSIS, THE DATA WERE
COMBINED, USING THE DODGE DEFINITION FOR 1932-63 AND
EXTRAPOLATING BACK TO 1919 BY THE NBER DEFINITION, LINKING
BY THE RATIO OF THE TWO ANNUAL TOTALS.
THE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED DATA PRESENTED HERE ARE SHOWN
AS A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE. RAISING RATIOS WERE APPLIED, CALCU-
LATED FROM ANNUAL TOTALS FOR THE EARLIEST YEAR OF SEGMENT
OVERLAPS, BEFORE ADJUSTMENT.  SEE INTRODUCTORY NOTES.

(1) V826 -- ORIGINAL DATA, 1919-1947; (2) V827 -- ORIGINAL
DATA, 1947-1963.
THIS INDEX MEASURES CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL VOLUME OF
PRODUCTION OF CLAY, GLASS, AND STONE MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS.
IT DOES NOT COVER STONE AND EARTH MINERALS. IT IS BASED ON
PRODUCTION OR SHIPMENTS DATA FROM THE BUREAU OF THE CENSUS,
THE BUREAU OF MINES, AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, SUCH AS THE
AMERICAN GLASSWARE ASSOCIATION; AND ON BLS MAN-HOURS DATA.
THE INDEX IS AVAILABLE ON THE 1957-59 BASE ONLY FROM
1947; FOR EARLIER YEARS THE LATEST DATA ARE ON A 1935-39
BASE. THIS SERIES IS THEREFORE SHOWN HERE IN TWO SEGMENTS
WITH AN OVERLAP OF ONE YEAR.
MOST CLAY, GLASS, AND STONE PRODUCTS (85 PER CENT OF THE
OUTPUT IN 1957-59) ARE CLASSIFIED AS CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE INDEX FOR THAT MARKET GROUP. IN
1957-59 THEY ACCOUNTED FOR OVER ONE- QUARTER OF TOTAL
PRODUCTION OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.
MAJOR REVISIONS OF THE CLAY, GLASS, AND STONE INDEX WERE
MADE IN 1940, 1943, 1953, 1959, AND 1962. IN ADDITION TO
CHANGES IN THE BASE PERIOD, THE REVISIONS AFFECTED THE
COMPOSITION OF THE INDEX, WEIGHTING, ADJUSTMENT TO BENCHMARK
LEVELS, TYPES OF BASIC DATA USED, AND METHOD OF SEASONAL
ADJUSTMENT.
SEASONAL AND WORKING-DAY ADJUSTMENTS ARE BY THE SOURCE.
FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INDEX AND THE
REVISIONS, SEE ABOVE SOURCES AND""FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN"",

NOTES: CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS IS ONE OF THE MARKET GROUPINGS
INTRODUCED IN THE 1959 REVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION INDEXES. INDEXES FOR MOST OF THE
EIGHTEEN SERIES WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS CONSTRUCTION
MATERIALS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED MONTHLY SINCE 1919, BUT THE
COMPOSITE INDEX BEGINS IN 1947.
THE INDEX IS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF RELATIVES. BEGINNING
IN 1953, THE WEIGHTS ARE BASED ON VALUE ADDED, 1957-59,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED BY EXTRAPOLATING FROM 1957 VALUE ADDED BY
THE RATIO OF PRODUCTION IN 1957-59 TO PRODUCTION IN 1957.
FOR 1947-52, THE WEIGHTS WERE BASED ON 1947 VALUE ADDED
DATA; HOWEVER, THE WEIGHTED INDEX WAS LINKED IN JANUARY 1953
TO A WEIGHTED INDEX (IN THE 1959 RESIVION) AND SUBSEQUENTLY
CONVERTED TO THE PRESENT REFERENCE PERIOD OF 1957-59. THE
COMPONENT MONTHLY SERIES ARE ADJUSTED TO BENCHMARK DATA FROM
THE CENSUS OF MANUFACTURES AND TO INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED
ANNUAL INDEXES.
THE INDEXES REPRESENT AVERAGE PRODUCTION PER WORKING DAY
WITH PUBLIC ANNUAL HOLIDAYS COUNTED AS WORKING DAYS BUT
ALLOWED FOR IN THE SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT.
SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT IS BY THE SOURCE.

NOTES: THESE TWO SERIES WERE INITIATED BY THE BUREAU OF THE
CENSUS IN 1963, IN CONNECTION WITH A MAJOR REVISION OF THE
FORMER MONTHLY""INDUSTRY SURVEY"" OF THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS
ECONOMICS. DATA ON SIX MARKET CATEGORIES, WHICH CUT ACROSS
MAJOR INDUSTRY GROUPINGS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE NEW SERIES.
THE MARKET CATEGORY""CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, SUPPLIES,
AND INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS"" INCLUDES LUMBER AND WOOD
PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING WOODEN CONTAINERS; BUILDING PAPER;
PAINTS AND RELATED PRODUCTS; PAVING AND ROOFING MATERIALS;
ALL STONE, CLAY, AND GLASS PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING GLASS
CONTAINERS AND KITCHEN ARTICLES; AND FABRICATED METAL
BUILDING MATERIALS AND WIRE PRODUCTS.
DATA ARE COLLECTED FROM A SAMPLE PANEL OF MANUFACTURING
COMPANIES. THEY ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY FOR UNITS WITHIN A
COMPANY WHICH ARE REASONABLY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO TYPE OF
ACTIVITY. THESE UNITS MAY BE SUBSIDIARIES, DIVISIONS,
DEPARTMENTS, OR PLANTS, DEPENDING UPON THE STRUCTURE AND
ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTICULAR FIRM.
MONTHLY SHIPMENT ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE SAMPLE, AND
DATA FROM THE""ANNUAL SURVEY OF MANUFACTURES"" ARE USED AS
ANNUAL BENCHMARKS. THE LATTER ARE ESTABLISHMENT-BASED DATA,
IN CONTRAST TO THE COMPANY-BASED DATA FROM""STATISTICS OF
INCOME"" WHICH WERE USED AS BENCHMARKS IN THE FORMER
""INDUSTRY SURVEY"". AS AN INTERIM PROCEDURE, PENDING FURTHER
STUDY OF THE PROPER LEVEL FOR AUGUST 1962 WAS ESTABLISHED BY
RELATING THE RATIO OF UNFILLED ORDERS TO SHIPMENTS (FROM THE
SAMPLE) TO THE AUGUST 1962 SHIPMENTS ESTIMATES FOR EACH
DETAILED CATEGORY. THE ESTIMATES FOR NEW ORDERS ARE NET OF
CANCELLATIONS. THEY ARE DERIVED BY ADDING THE CHANGE IN
UNFILLED ORDERS BETWEEN THE CURRENT AND PREVIOUS MONTH TO
THE SHIPMENTS ESTIMATE. TABULATION OF THE SERIES ON THE NEW
BENCHMARK BASIS WAS BEGUN WITH JANUARY 1960 DATA.
APPROXIMATELY COMPARABLE MONTHLY DATA WERE DEVELOPED FOR
1953-1959.
SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT IS BY THE SOURCE. DATA SHOWN WITHOUT
SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED FOR TRADING-DAY AND
CALENDAR-MONTH VARIATION.
THE SOURCE INCLUDES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SERIES
AND A COMPARISON OF THE SHIPMENT DATA WITH THE FEDERAL

NOTES: THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES
DIVISION OF THE BUSINESS AND DEFENSE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPILING THESE DATA. THE COMPOSITE INDEX
MEASURES CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL VOLUME OF OUTPUT OF TEN
GROUPS OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, WHICH TOGETHER REPRESENTED
ABOUT 50 PER CENT OF THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF SHIPMENTS OF ALL
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS IN 1947. MATERIALS INCLUDED ARE IRON
AND STEEL PRODUCTS; LUMBER AND WOOD PRODUCTS; PORTLAND
CEMENT, MILLWORK, PAINT, VARNISH, AND LACQUER, ASPHALT
PRODUCTS; HEATING AND PLUMBING EQUIPMENT; CLAY CONSTRUCTION
PRODUCTS; GYPSUM PRODUCTS; AND PLUMBING FIXTURES.
AN INDEX FOR EACH OF THE TEN GROUPS IS CONSTRUCTED FROM
DATA ON PRODUCTION, SALES, OR SHIPMENTS OF ONE OR MORE
SPECIFIC MATERIALS.DATA ARE COMPILED QUARTERLY FOR GYPSUM
PRODUCTS AND PLUMBING FIXTURES, AND MONTHLY FOR THE OTHER
EIGHT GROUPS. INDEXES ARE DERIVED ON A 1947-49 BASE, USING

AVERAGES HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY NBER BY AVERAGING ALL THE
WEEKLY HIGHS AND LOWS FALLING WITHIN ANY ONE MONTH.  THE
USUAL BUREAU 3-4 METHOD (INCLUDING A WEEK ENDING ON THE 3RD
AS FALLING WITHIN THE PAST MONTH) HAS NOT BEEN FOLLOWED IN
THIS SERIES.  THIS NEW PRECEDENT IS TAKEN FROM H.A. WALLACE,
""AGRICULTURAL PRICES,"" WHERE THIS METHOD IS USED.
WHERE FIGURES ARE OMITTED IN THE SOURCE, WHETHER HIGHS
OR LOWS, THE MISSING FIGURES HAVE BEEN FILLED BY THE AVERAGE
OF THE REMAINING HIGHS OR LOWS, RESPECTIVELY, THUS GIVING
ALWAYS EQUAL WEIGHTS TO THE NUMBER OF HIGH AND LOW
QUOTATIONS.
THE GRADES QUOTED CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT EXCEPT
IN 1900, THEY APPEAR TO BE COMPARABLE, THIS SOMETIMES SHOWN
BY OVERLAPS.  THE CHANGE FROM 1899 TO 1900 WAS A JUMP OF
SEVERAL GRADES, THAT IS, FROM 5-A TO 2-A, THUS MAKING THE
1900 DATA ON ON TOO HIGH A LEVEL TO BE COMPARABLE WITH
PREVIOUS DATA.  THEREFORE, FROM 1900 ON, THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FIGURES SHOULD BE USED.  THESE
DATA REFER TO MONTHLY AVERAGE PRICES FOR NATIVE BEEF STEERS,
ALL WEIGHTS, 750-1800 POUNDS, COMPILED BY THE CHICAGO DAILY
DROVERS JOURNAL. BEGINNING WITH JANUARY, 1922, THEY ARE
AVERAGE PRICES OF ALL GRADES COMPILED BY UNITED STATES

THE MONTHLY HIGH AND LOW AS THEY APPEAR IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
OF THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.  THE GRADE USED HERE WAS
""HEAVY PACKING, 250-500 POUNDS,"" TO CONTINUE THE GRADE
SPECIFIED BY WALLACE. THE WALLACE DATA, 1896 TO 1919,
WAS COMPILED BY CHARLES A.S. MCCRACKEN FOR THE CHICAGO
DROVERS JOURNAL YEARBOOK.  FOR 1881-1895, INCLUSIVE, THE
AVERAGE OF THE RANGE OF CHICAGO HOG PRICES, AS COMPILED BY
THE CINCINNATI PRICE CURRENT HAVE BEEN USED.  THESE PRICES
REFER MORE NEARLY TO AVERAGE HOGS THAN TO HEAVY HOGS.
PREVIOUS TO 1881, PRICES HAVE BEEN COMPILED FROM CHICAGO
BOARD OF TRADE REPORTS, THE GRADE KNOWN AS HEAVY PACKERS AND
SHIPPERS BEING USED SO FAR AS POSSIBLE.
A STRIKE FROM NOVEMBER 21-DECEMBER 3, 1938 RESULTED IN

SHOWS THAT PRICES INCREASED SOMEWHAT IN LATE FALL OF 1956

NORMAL TIMES CONTINUED TO OPERATE THROUGH 1916 AND UNTIL
THE MIDDLE OF 1917, ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER PART OF THIS
PERIOD CONDITIONS WERE FAR FROM NORMAL.  A TREMENDOUS
INCREASE IN DEMAND, WHICH BEGAN IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 1916
AND EXTENDED THROUGH 1918 UNTIL THE ARMISTICE WAS DECLARED
IN NOVEMBER, BROUGHT FORTH AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION TO A
POINT WHERE THE LIMIT OF RAILROAD CAPACITY WAS TEMPORARILY
REACHED WITH THE DEMAND STILL UNSATISFIED.  BECAUSE THE
DEMAND COULD NOT BE FULLY SATISFIED, PRICES IN THE FALL OF
1916 AND IN 1917 ROSE TO ALMOST UNHEARD OF FIGURES, UNTIL
FIRST VOLUNTARY AND THEN LATER GOVERNMENT CONTROL WAS

IN 1942, INVENTORY (I.E. STOCK) FIGURES IN CERTAIN

SOURCE:  DATA FOR 1919-1938 ARE FROM SURVEY OF CURRENT
BUSINESS, JULY 1934 AND FOLLOWING ISSUES; DATA FOR 1939-1947
WERE COMPUTED BY NBER

NOTES:  DATA PUBLISHED IN THE SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS
WERE COMPUTED BY THE MACHINE TOOL BUILDER'S ASSOCIATION.
THEY CONSTITUTE AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE DATA
CURRENTLY BEING COLLECTED AND THE SERIES PREVIOUSLY
PRESENTED TO FORM A CONTINUOUS SERIES.  IN MAKING THE
ADJUSTMENT, THE WHOLE CURVE WAS RAISED TO BRING IT INTO LINE
WITH THE 1926 SHIPMENTS LAW.  THIS WAS DONE BY DIVIDING THE
WHOLE INDEX THROUGH A CONSTANT FACTOR WHICH REPRESENTED THE
AVERAGE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE NEW AND OLD INDEX NUMBERS FOR
ALL THE COMPANIES WHICH HAD REPORTED CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE
15 YEAR PERIOD.  THE FACTOR USED WAS 180.3.  THE ASSOCIATION
RECEIVED REPORTS FROM 50-60 COMPANIES FOR THE YEARS
1919-1927; 60-80 COMPANIES FOR 1928-1933; AND 163 BEGINNING
WITH JANUARY 1934.  SINCE JANUARY 1934, DATA HAVE BEEN
GATHERED FROM THE MACHINE TOOL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND ALSO
FROM THE FORGING MACHINERY GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS LESS THAN
3% OF THE COMBINED GROUPING.  NO CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE
FOR SEASONAL VARIATIONS FOR THE REASON THAT SUCH INFLUENCES
ARE RELATIVELY SLIGHT.
THE INDEX WAS PUBLISHED THROUGH AUGUST 1939 AND THEN
REPLACED BY A SERIES BASED ON PRODUCTIVE HOURS AND CAPACITY
OF COMPANIES REPORTING, NOT USED HERE.  DATA FOR 1939-1947
WERE DERIVED BY NBER BY MULTIPLYING DOLLAR FIGURES BY THE
RATIO:  INDEXES 1938/DOLLAR FIGURES 1938 = 1233.0/103.89 =
11.86832.

NOTES:  FOR 1894-1933, THE DATA ARE FOR""GENERAL IMPORTS"".
FOR 1934-1941, THE DATA ARE FOR""IMPORTS FOR CONSUMPTION"".
THIS SERIES IS TREATED AS BEING CONTINUOUS, BUT FOR DETAILS
PLEASE SEE THE NOTES BELOW.
THIS SERIES OF LEAD IMPORTS WAS SHOWN SEPARATELY
BEGINNING IN MARCH, 1894. THE SERIES WAS NAMED""LEAD AND
LEAD CONTENT IMPORTS"".  THE SERIES WAS NAMED""LEAD IN ORE""
BEGINNING IN JULY, 1897.  IT WAS ALSO CALLED""IMPORTS OF
LEAD (PIGS, BARS, OLD, AND OTHER IN ORE)"" AS WELL AS""LEAD
AND IN ORE, ETC"".  BEGINNING IN JULY, 1900, THE SERIES WAS
CALLED""LEAD IN ORE AND BASE BULLION"".  BEGINNING IN JULY,
1909, THE SERIES WAS CALLED""LEAD IN ORE, BULLION, AND BASE
BULLION"".
THE CHANGE IN NAME BEGINNING IN JULY, 1897 DOES NOT
GREATLY AFFECT THE COMPARABILITY OF THE SERIES.  THIS CAN BE
SEEN BY COMPARING THE IMPORT FIGURES OF THE TWO FOLLOWING
YEARS.  UNDER THE HEADING OF""LEAD IN ORE, ETC."" THE FIGURE
FOR JUNE-JULY 1897/8 WAS 181.66.  UNDER THE HEADING OF
""PIGS, BARS, AND OLD"" THE FIGURE FOR JUNE-JULY 1897/8 WAS
3.31.  THE FIGURES FOR THE TWO HEADINGS FOR JUNE-JULY 1898/9
WERE 195.93 AND 0.45, RESPECTIVELY.
BEGINNING IN JULY, 1910, THE SERIES WAS CALLED""LEAD
ORE, LEAD CONTENT, LEAD IN OTHER ORE, BULLION AND BASE
BULLION"".  LEAD IN OTHER ORE WAS EXCLUDED PRIOR TO JULY,
1910.  BEGINNING IN OCTOBER, 1913, LEAD IN OTHER ORE IS
INCLUDED IN LEAD ORE.
BEGINNING IN OCTOBER, 1922, THE SERIES WAS CALLED""LEAD
ORE, MATTE, BULLION, AND BASE BULLION"".
UNREVISED FIGURES ARE GIVEN BEGINNING IN DECEMBER,
1931.
AN NBER NOTE ACCOMPANYING DATA FOR 1933 READS
""(EXCLUDES IMPORTS FOR SMELTING, REFINING, AND EXPORT--FOR
THIS YEAR ONLY)?"" (N.B.  NOTE THAT THE QUESTION MARK WAS
ADDED TO THE NOTE BY NBER).
BEGINNING WITH JANUARY, 1934 THE DATA ARE FOR IMPORTS
FOR CONSUMPTION ONLY.  THIS INCLUDES IMPORTS GOING INTO
IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION PLUS WITHDRAWALS FROM BONDED
WAREHOUSES.
BEGINNING IN 1936, THE DATA INCLUDES SOME""PIGS AND
BARS"" AND""RECLAIMED ""RECLAIMED SCRAP, DROSS AND LEAD,
N.S.P.F., EXCEPT ANTINOMIAL LEAD"", WHOSE FIGURES ARE LUMPED
WITH ORE AND BULLION IN THE ITEM FOR""FOR SMELTING,
REFINING, AND EXPORT"".  HOWEVER,""PIGS AND BARS"" AND
""RECLAIMED SCRAP"", ETC. ARE RELATIVELY UNIMPORTANT IN THIS
ITEM.  SEE THE SERIES DESCRIPTION""IMPORTS OF LEAD (ORE,

VARIABLES--(1)--ORIGINAL DATA, 1887-1924 (2)--ORIGINAL DATA,
1920-1939.
THESE DATA ARE BASED ON RETURNS COLLECTED BY THE BOARD
OF TRADE AND THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR FROM VARIOUS TRADE
UNIONS WHICH PAID UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.  PERSONS ON STRIKE,
LOCKED OUT, SICK, OR SUPERANNUATED ARE EXCLUDED.  THE
PERCENTAGES FOR SOME OF THE EARLIER YEARS ARE PARTLY
COMPUTED FROM THE EXPENDITURES OF THE SEVERAL UNIONS ON
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT.
MARCH AND APRIL 1912 WERE AFFECTED BY THE NATIONAL COAL
DISPUTE.
IN 1919, SKILLED MEN PERMANENTLY ENGAGED IN THEIR
TRADES FORMED A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE MEMBERS OF THESE
TRADE UNIONS.  UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE EARLY PART OF 1919 WAS
LARGELY OF SEMI-SKILLED MEN WHO WERE DISCHARGED FROM
INDUSTRIES WHICH THEY HAD ONLY ENTERED FOR WAR PURPOSES.
THE FIGURES GIVEN HERE THEREFORE MAY NOT FULLY INDICATE THE
AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT (LABOR GAZETTE, JANUARY 20, P.3).
APRIL-JUNE, 1921 DATA EXCLUDE THE COAL MINERS' STOPPAGE
IN INDUSTRY.
1924 DATA INCLUDE POTTERY AND ARE A CONTINUATION OF
EARLIER DATA.  LABOUR GAZETTE DISCONTINUED POTTERY TRADE
OPERATIONS AT END OF MAY 1924 BUT NO CHANGE IS MADE IN DATA
FOR MARCH-MAY 1924 FOR EXCLUSION IN BOTH THE ABSTRACT AND

NUMBER OF INSURED PERSONS RECORDED AS UNEMPLOYED AND THE
FIGURES FOR 1928 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS ARE THEREFORE NOT

PURPOSES, HOWEVER, THE PERCENATGES UNEMPLOYED CAN BE
REGARDED AS COMPARABLE THROUGHOUT.

SWITCHING AND TERMINAL COMPANIES). THE INDEX IS COMPUTED BY
RELATING THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AS OF THE MIDDLE OF EACH
MONTH TO THE NUMBER IN THE BASE PERIOD WHICH WAS 1,786,258.
IN ADJUSTING THE INDEX FOR SEASONAL VARIATION, THE
""RATIO-TO-MOVING-AVERAGE"" METHOD (12 MONTHS) WAS USED (USING
DATA FOR THE PERIOD 1924-1932). IF ANY RAILWAYS ARE EITHER
ADDED TO OR DROPPED FROM CLASS I CLASSIFICATION, DATA FOR
SUCH ROADS ARE EITHER INCLUDED OR EXCLUDED AS THE CASE MAY
BE, BUT NO CHANGE IS MADE IN THE BASE FIGURE USED IN

P. 80; AND FOLLOWING ABSTRACTS; DATA FOR 1934 ONLY IS FROM
MINISTRY OF LABOUR GAZETTE.

NOTES:  DATA FROM 1895-1909 REFER TO THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF
DAYS WORKED PER WEEK DURING THE MONTH, BASED ON 4 WEEKS.
DATA BEGINNING IN 1910 REFER TO THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS
WORKED PER WEEK FOR ONE FORTNIGHT PER MONTH -- SOMETIMES THE
FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE MONTH, SOMETIMES THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
DATA INCLUDE IRON ORE AND IRONSTONE MINES AND
OPENWORKS.
DATA FOR MAY-NOVEMBER, 1898 ARE AFFECTED BY EMPLOYMENT
IN SCOTLAND. THE DROP IN MARCH, 1912 IS THE RESULT OF A
GENERAL COAL MINING STOPPAGE.
BEGINNING IN 1920 IT IS ASSUMED THAT DATA REFER ONLY TO
MINES IN GREAT BRITAIN. A GENERAL COAL MINING STOPPAGE
OCCURED IN OCTOBER, 1920.
EMPLOYMENT IS LOW IN MAY-DECEMBER, 1926 PRIMARILY AS
THE RESULT OF THE DECREASED DEMAND FOR IRON ORE AT IRON ORE
AND STEEL WORKS DUE TO A SHORTAGE OF FUEL. MOST OF THE MINES
WERE CLOSED DOWN DURING MAY AND BY THE END OF THE MONTH THE
INDUSTRY WAS ALMOST AT A TOTAL STANDSTILL. COAL MINING
DISPUTES AFFECTED MINING DURING SUBSEQUENT MONTHS.

BEGINNING WITH JANUARY, 1949 MONTHLY REPORT (BACK DATA
GIVEN FOR 1948) ABOUT 60 COMPANIES WHICH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS HAVE BEEN OMITTED.  BASED ON ANNUAL
OPERATING REVENUES, THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES
AFFECTS THE COMPARABILITY OF THE DATA BY LESS THAN 3% (SEE

FROM THE OLD AND NEW SERIES WERE LINKED BY THE NBER AND THE

BY MULTIPLYING DATA FROM ONE PERIOD BY A COEFFICIENT
EQUAL TO THE RATIO OF THE OLD TO THE NEW, A SINGLE SERIES

JULY 30, 1914 WAS THE DAY OF CLOSING FOR THE EXCHANGE.
THE STOCK EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED FOR THE MONTHS OF
SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER, 1914.
EIGHT SHARES WERE INCLUDED FOR THE PERIOD
04/1887-12/1895.  THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF
SECURITIES INCLUDED (A DECREASE OF ONE, FROM EIGHT TO SEVEN)
IN 12/1906.  IN 12/1921, THE NUMBER OF INCLUDED SECURITIES
INCREASED FROM 7 TO 9.
AN NBER NOTE ATTRIBUTES THE DECLINE IN THE INDEX AFTER
JUNE, 1916 TO UNUSUAL STOCK MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, THE
ABOLITION OF MINIMUM RATES, AND AN INCREASE IN THE BANK
RATE.  THERE IS NO FIGURE FOR JANUARY, 1916 BECAUSE OF THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE MINIMUM WOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE THE END
OF THE MONTH.  THE ESTIMATE FOR THE JANUARY, 1915 PRICES IS
BASED ON MARKINGS, THE OFFICIAL LIST, AND WHERE THE
SECURITIES ARE INACTIVE, THE JULY 27, 1914 PRICES.
THE VALUATION FOR AUGUST, 1921 WAS OMITTED BECAUSE OF
STAGNATION OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE

NOTES:  THIS SERIES MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE ANNUAL INDEX
GIVEN IN THE MAY, 1928 ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL (DESSINER) FOR

FOR 1919-1925, THE OLD INDEX WAS USED.  FOR 1926-1929,
A REVISION OF THE INDEX, FIRST COMPUTED IN JANUARY, 1922,
BASED UPON 194 SECURITIES IN 25 GROUPS, WITH EACH SECURITY
GIVEN THE WEIGHT OF 100 FRANCS IN THE BASE PERIOD 1901-1910.
THIS GAVE RISE TO CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES, BECAUSE AS ONE MOVES
AWAY FROM THE BASE PERIOD, DIFFERENT STOCKS BEGIN TO BE
WEIGHTED VERY DIFFERENTLY (AND NOT NECESARILY JUSTIFIABLY).
WHAT WAS DONE THEN, WAS TO COMPUTE FOR EACH SECURITY
ITS VALUE IN JANUARY, 1926 WHEN REFERRED TO A BASE WHOSE
BASE WAS ITS AVERAGE VALUE IN 1925.  THESE WERE THEN
AVERAGED TOGETHER, SO THAT EACH SECURITY WAS WEIGHTED
EQUALLY IN 1925, AND THE WHOLE GROUP THEN REFERRED BACK TO
1913.  THE EARLIER INDEX (FROM 1919-1925) WAS KEPT THE SAME
EXCEPT THAT IT WAS CONVERTED FROM THE BASE 1901-1910 TO
1913.  BUT JANUARY, 1926 OF THE NEW INDEX (FROM 1919-1925)
WAS MADE EQUAL TO THE OLD INDEX (211) AND AFTER JANUARY,
1926, THE SERIES REFERRED TO 288 SECURITIES IN 20 GROUPS.
THE GROUPS AND THE NUMBER OF SECURITIES INCLUDED IN
EACH GROUP ARE AS FOLLOWS: BANKS (13); TEXTILE INDUSTRIES
(13); INSURANCE COMPANIES (15); RAILROADS, GREAT SYSTEMS
(10); COAL MINES OF THE CENTER (7); RAILROADS, MISCELLANEOUS
AND URBAN TRANSPORT--FRANCE, ALGERIA, AND TUNIS (14); COAL
MINES OF THE NORTH (11); MISCELLANEOUS MINES--FRANCE,
ALGERIA, AND TUNIS (9); TRANSPORTATION--WATER (9); IRON AND
STEEL WORKS (13); GAS (12); METAL WORKS, MECHANICAL AND
ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION (24); ELECTRICITY (23); DIVERSE
INDUSTRIES (22); SHIPBUILDING (7); MISCELLANEOUS TRADING
(16); BULIDING MATERIALS (11); COLONIAL COMPANIES (25);
CHEMICAL PRODUCTS (16); FRENCH COMPANIES OPERATING ABROAD
(18).
THE OLD INDEX CONSISTED OF THESE GROUPS AND NUMBER OF
SECURITIES THEIR RESPECTIVE NUMBERS OF SECURITIES: BANKS AND
CREDIT INSTITUTIONS (13); MISCELLANEOUS FRENCH AND COLONIAL
RAILROADS (10); COAL MINES OF THE LOIRE AND CENTER (5);
URBAN TRANSPORT (6); NAVIGATION (6); DOCKS AND PIERS (3);
COAL MINES OF THE NORTH (10); IRON AND STEEL WORKS (10);
METAL MINES (4); SUEZ CANAL (1); METALS (4); MECHANICAL
CONSTRUCTION (5); GAS (12); SHIPBUILDING (5); WATER (4);

PRODUCTS--SALTS AND PHOSPHATES (11); BUILDING MATERIALS (5);
PRINTING (4); DEPARTMENT STORES (4); FOREIGN RAILROADS (8);
TEXTILES (2); FRENCH RAILROADS, MAJOR SYSTEMS (5).
THESE HAVE BEEN CORRECTED FOR CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION
AND DISTRIBUTION OF RESERVES.
SEE BULLETIN, JANUARY, 1932, P.243 AND FOLLOWING, FOR
1932 REVISIONS. THE METHOD AND BASE REMAINED THE SAME, BUT
IN 1929, THE NUMBER OF SECURITIES CHANGED FROM 288 IN 20
GROUPS TO 300 IN 22 GROUPS.  THE NEW GROUPS AND THE
RESPECTIVE NUMBER OF SECURITIES IN EACH GROUP IS AS FOLLOWS:
BANQUES (20); RAILROADS, MISCELLANEOUS AND URBAN (13);
ASSURANCES (15); HAUILLERES DU CENTRE (8); NAVIGATION (9);
HAUILLERES DU NORD (11); GAS (12); MISCELLANEOUS MINING (8);
